# Welcome to ERNIE

This draft document will take form through October 2017.

Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE) is a knowledge platform that integrates data sources relevant to 
research evaluation and enables the documentation of discovery networks and influential nodes within then. In this first 
phase of development, the platform will be tested with case studies spanning drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, 
behavioral interventions, and a drug discovery platform. Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. At present, 
ERNIE resides in a PostgreSQL 9.6 database in a Centos 7.3 environment in the Microsoft Azure cloud. ERNIE is being developed 
by NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE). This project has been funded in whole or part  with Federal funds from the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201700053C.
