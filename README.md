# Welcome to ERNIE

This draft document will take form through 2017.

Enhanced Research Network Informatics Environment (ERNIE) is a knowledge platform in which data relevant to  research evaluation are integrated. ERNIE enables the documentation of discovery networks and influential nodes within them. In this first phase of development, ERNIE will be tested with case studies spanning drug development, medical devices/diagnostics, behavioral interventions, and a drug discovery platform. The focus of these case studies is substance abuse and results will be posted at the earliest. 

Emphasis is placed on the use of Open Source technologies. At present, ERNIE resides in a PostgreSQL 9.6 database in a Centos 7.3 VM in the Microsoft Azure cloud. ERNIE is being developed by NET ESolutions Corporation (NETE). As of October 15, 2017 the project has been active for a month. Initial server infrastructure has been set up and core data have been scraped, parsed, loaded, and mostly curated. The data in ERNIE are drawn through a variety of ETL processes from both publicly available and commercial sources. The project team will add additional data sources as and when they become available. 

This project has been funded in whole or part  with Federal funds from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN271201700053C.
