# Analysis of Observed Co-citation Data

This folder contains code relevant to analyzing the observed co-citation frequencies in Scopus.

- lognorm_buckets.exe
  - Purpose: compute the Maximium Likleihood Estimator (MLE) parameters for a lognormal distribution.
  - Compiled C++ program using a modified version of amoeba.h from Numerical recipes in C: The art of scientific computing (3rd ed.) by Press, W.H. and Teukolsky, S.A. and Vetterling, W.T. and Flannery, B.P.
  - Input arguments:
     - Reads a text file df_freq.csv from the same folder in which the executable resides with no headers, the first column indicating the co-citation frequency and the second column indicating the probability of each frequency, as shown below. The data in each row are separated by tabs.  The values in the second column should, naturally, sum to 1.

  - Output:
    - mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution underlying the lognormal distribution that is the MLE solution
  - This program was executed from a Python program to determine the moments of the lognormal distribution as mentioned above.
