We note that the caption of Fig 6 of Chandrasekharan comprises the following.

"Figure 6. Article and author citations of a 92 node cluster with 386 authors. The visualization shows citations between clusters, articles, and
authors as well as co-authorship relationships. A. Inter- and intra-cluster citation activity of a 92 node cluster (orange-brown) with its best
connected cluster (yellow). Each node is an article and each edge is a citation. B. Intra-cluster citation activity of the 92 node cluster. Each
node is an article and each edge is a citation. Four articles receive most of the citations. Node size is proportional to citing activity. Color
intensity is proportional to number of citations received. C. Author network from the same 92 node cluster. Each node is an author. Node size
is proportional to citing activity. Color intensity is proportional to number of citations received. The cluster comprises 25 Tier 1 authors and
386 Tier 3 authors. Tier 1 authors are seen as nodes located inside the circumference of the plot. D. Co-authorship network. Each node is an
author. Each edge is a co-author instance. Color intensity is proportional to the frequency of co-authorship between two authors. Five large 
coauthor groups can be seen."

The statement "The cluster comprises 25 Tier 1 authors and 386 Tier 3 authors." apparently conflicts with the opening statement "Article and 
author citations of a 92 node cluster with 386 authors." unless interpreted as all Tier 1 authors also being Tier 3 authors in the same cluster.
The query written to count the Tier assignment to an author selects the minimum value of Tiers based on the number of articles an author
has in the cluster. We are unable to offer further clarification because our license to Scopus data expired and we deleted all data from
this project that contained ScopusIDs and Scopus Author IDs.
