NAME

    active_processes.sh -- check the processes of the effective users and/or user groups

SYNOPSIS

    active_processes.sh [-u user] [-g group] ... [max_number_of_processes]
    active_processes.sh -h: display this help

DESCRIPTION

    Check the "active" processes of effective user(s) or group(s).

    "Active" processes are all processes excluding:

    1. `sshd` processes
    2. Login shells, e.g. `-bash`
    3. Status `T`: stopped by job control signal
    3. Status `Z`: defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

    The following options are available:

    -u user                 Linux user name or EUID

    -g group                Linux group name or EGID

    max_number_of_processes defaults to 0

EXIT STATUS

    The utility exits with one of the following values:

    0   Didn't exceed the maximum number of processes
    1   Exceeded the maximum number of processes

EXAMPLES

        $ max_processes.sh -u jenkins 1
