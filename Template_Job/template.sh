# -x Print a trace of simple commands, for commands, case commands, select commands, and arithmetic for commands and
# their arguments or associated word lists after they are expanded and before they are executed.
#
# -e Exit immediately if a pipeline, a single simple command , a list (see Lists), or a compound command returns a
#   non-zero status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is:
#   * part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword
#   * part of the test in an if statement
#   * part of any command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||
#   * any command in a pipeline but the last
#   * or if the commandâ€™s return status is being inverted with !
